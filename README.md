# StyleCalendar

StyleCalendar is a calendar add-on for [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com). Its goal is to offer a simple, extendable calendar component with an easily themeable client-side DOM structure. 
Its features include:

* setting stylenames for individual days
* disabling date ranges and individual days
* customizable header and week numbers
* tooltip support

See the [Directory page](http://vaadin.com/addon/stylecalendar) for more info and demo links.
